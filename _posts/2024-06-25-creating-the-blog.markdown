I have set up the Jekyll site for the blog I will use to detail this small project.

It will reside on the gh-pages branch of the main project repo, to keep everything tidy.

I followed the official GitHub pages guide for this:
- [Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

It will be hosted on [bjornthiberg.github.io/project_frej](https://bjornthiberg.github.io/project_frej)
